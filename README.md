### Sounds Boxes

## Process
It was my inaugural web development project, and it proved to be an amazing journey. I delved into the history of music genres, discovering a few that I didn't know existed. It was a fun experience.

## Built with
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript

## Development
The web page is filled with numerous buttons, and by clicking on a genre, it activates and starts playing. You have the option to select more than one genre. If you have a fondness for music, you can create melodies of your choice.
